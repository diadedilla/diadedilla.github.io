    body: '3 years ago on April 28th, Día de Dilla was birthed from the collective minds of 7 intrepid young industrialists. In a moment of pure inspiration, gracious hosts from JAAED offered 3 hungry borthers tortillas, cheese, and some leftover chicken to do with as they pleased, and the rest was history. Each year, the event has given rise to new, exciting, creations from the signature smores yeet-dilla to the poignant California Roll Jaaedilla. Now, Día de Dilla, taking place annually on the last Saturday of April has become an institution; a day of innovation, celebration, and elation, dedicated to the noble craft of forging “dillas”.'

    body: 'The yeetadilla and yeet-dilla are frequently confused for one another, and while similar is many aspects, the two are also a world apart. The yeetadilla has its origins in the Frisian word for cheese, "tsiis", and the Mexican word "quesadilla". Formally, it is best described as a quesadilla using two tortillas, with cheese on both sides of each. The earliest known reference is dated cerca 2018. The term "yeet-dilla" originated around the same time in completely different circumstances. It refers to a sweeter cuisine, one generally enjoyed following a meal (typically of yeetadilla).'
