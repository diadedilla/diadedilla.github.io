export const HISTORY = '3 years ago on April 28th, Día de Dilla was birthed from the collective minds of 7 intrepid young industrialists. In a moment of pure inspiration, gracious hosts from JAAED offered 3 hungry borthers tortillas, cheese, and some leftover chicken to do with as they pleased, and the rest was history. Each year, the event has given rise to new, exciting, creations from the signature smores yeet-dilla to the poignant California Roll Jaaedilla. Now, Día de Dilla, taking place annually on the last Saturday of April has become an institution; a day of innovation, celebration, and elation, dedicated to the noble craft of forging “dillas”.'
